Application initializes as the following way: (6.0.3)

1. basic file system init

2. find root directory in file setting.cfg, reading casc infos

3. log info in logs\resource.log

4. read dbc and db2 (wow databases) as needed

5. log db info in logs\resource.log

6. initialize video deivce (directx9, directx11)

7. video init info is logged in logs\gx.log

8. other engine initialization (engine, audio, input)

9. explorer data and UI init


Common Errors (which result in launch failure):

1. .Net Framework 4 not installed. If so you can test App1.exe to see its lauch.

2. DirectX9 not installed. Information be kept in logs (step 5 above is right)

3. cannot find wow data(casc). Engine will seatch local directory for mpqs if path in setting.cfg is not valid.

4. data content error. This often results in dbc reading error. See logs (step 5 above to see which dbc fails).

5. video init error. Please check video card is right configured to run 3D application.


Please contact me if you have any trouble to run it or any good suggestions.
